# STK-Scenarios

### STK Object-Model and Connect Automation Scripts using Python

![My STK Integration swag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammmlow/STK-Scenarios/main/Swag/agi_swag.jpg)

Note: Not all of the code was written by me. Much of it are code snippets by the AGI guys.

Note: Requires the full STK license for Connect and the Object Model APIs to work.
