    "# <font style=\"color: rgb(190,138,67);\">CERTIFICATION OVERVIEW</font>\n",
    "***\n",
    "Welcome to Level 2: STK Master Integration Certification!  STK Integration allows users to automate STK with other applications and to extend its capabilities using various development environments (C#, C++, Visual Basic, Java, MATLAB, Perl, Python, VBScript, JScript). This set of exercises will show you how to integrate and automate STK with Python. Each exercise is organized around high-level tasks, where you will produce your own code and answer questions. In this certification, you will use Python to build an STK scenario and extract data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, this certification assumes you completed the STK Level 1 Certification and possess some familiarity with coding. **Make sure you downloaded the programs and materials necessary to complete the test from the [Access Resources Page](https://register.agi.com/training/on-demand/stk-master/integration/).** Review that page to see the list of required software and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this certification, you will answer sections of questions. **Keep track of your answers.** You will need to submit your answers through ClassMarker to complete the test. See *Submission Instructions* in the registration email for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STK Integration Certification exercises will focus on ways to automate and integrate STK technology with other applications. This will be done by externally interfacing with STK through COM. Additional integration options include developing custom applications and extending STK using plugins. Through this certification, you will learn the basic skills required to master all types of integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "Many of the certification's exercises stem from a mock problem: you and your team have plans for a constellation of low-earth orbit satellites to provide near continuous global coverage. The constellation is being loosely modeled after the Iridium satellite constellation that provides worldwide L band voice and data coverage for satellite phones. The tentative plan is for a constellation of 32 satellites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your teammate has been working on identifying suitable locations for ground facilities that will support the operation of this constellation and has provided you with a list of their top 20 candidate locations. You need to determine the quality of coverage at each of the candidate ground stations. To conduct this initial analysis, you should use Python to automate the process in STK. \n",

    "## <font style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\">EXERCISE 1: </font> <font style=\"color: rgb(190,138,67);\">Connect and STK Object Model</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "This exercise introduces the two major subsystems of the STK API: Connect and the STK Object Model. These two subsystems enable users to automate and extend STK's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "The Connect module is a library of string commands for STK that are easy to read, understand, and build. Connect was originally designed to operate over a TCP/IP socket. But, Connect works with STK through the COM interface as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Connect communicates with STK and 3D Graphics so you can visualize events in real-time. For instance, you can use Connect to feed real-time telemetry data from the launch and early orbit of a mission. As a scenario, the data can be viewed in 2D or 3D to visualize the mission and assist in understanding and resolving any issues that may arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/ConnectArch.png\" width=450></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Executing Connect Commands\n",
    "To communicate with STK using Connect commands from an external application or an HTML page, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A TCP/IP connection to send Connect commands over a specified port. The default port for this connection is 5001, but you can change it within STK by selecting *Edit &#8594; Preferences* and navigating to the Connect page.\n",
    "- The COM interface to STK to send Connect commands directly to STK without communicating through a port.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Connect Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a new scenario named See_DC:\n",
    "\n",
    "`New / Scenario See_DC`   \n",
    "\n",
    "To set the time period for the current scenario to start at midnight (local time) of the current day and to end 4 hours later:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SetAnalysisTimePeriod * \"Today\" \"+4 hours\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the Sun constraint so that access to the DC facility is only valid while the facility is in full sunlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SetConstraint */Facility/DC Lighting DirectSun`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Connect\n",
    "- Connect commands are easy to read, understand, and build.\n",
    "- Connect commands make it very easy to set multiple parameters on one or multiple objects with a single command.\n",
    "- The TCP/IP interface enables STK to receive Connect commands from other applications on the same machine, or other machines.\n",
    "- Connect commands can be sent from applications in any programming language; all that is required is a socket connection to STK.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connect Limitations\n",
    "- When generating Reports and Graphs with Connect, you must use pre-defined Report and Graph styles installed on the target machine.\n",
    "- Any report data returned from a Connect command will come in the form of a string, which must be parsed.\n",
    "- The Connect library is weighted heavily towards setting object properties. It is not always possible to \"get\" current object properties with Connect.\n",
    "- Connect does not support auto completion or compile-time debugging. To determine whether a Connect command contains a syntax error, send the command to STK and check for an \"ACK\" (acknowledged) or \"NACK\" (not acknowledged) response.\n",
    "- While Connect offers a \"Verbose\" mode for debugging, specific error messages are not always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STK Object Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The STK Object Model is a collection of COM libraries containing types, interfaces, events and classes. These aspects let you design custom solutions using STK and the STK Engine. The STK Engine is a user-friendly API that can extend the capabilities of STK for your needs. The STK Object Model is available for use with STK as well as custom-built STK Engine applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components in STK Object Model let developers:\n",
    "- Control and automate STK objects \n",
    "- Manage the lifetime of STK objects\n",
    "- Access Data Provider Tools\n",
    "- Perform access and coverage computations\n",
    "- Respond to events generated by STK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STK Object Model is built on Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) technology and can be used in environments supporting standard COM automation. Available environments include .NET(Visual Basic, C#, etc.), Java, C++, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and scripting languages supporting COM late binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Component Object Model (COM)\n",
    "The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "COM is not an object-oriented language but a standard. When working with COM, you have to fill in the language, structure, and implementation details. Rather, COM specifies an object model and programming requirements that enable COM objects (also called COM components, or sometimes simply objects) to interact with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "COM defines a **COM object** with a set of data and related functions. You use the set of related functions to access the COM object's data. \n",
    "\n",
    "These sets of functions are called **interfaces**. The individual functions of an interface are called **methods**. COM uses **pointers** to gain access to the methods of an interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about COM checkout the full write up in [Microsoft's Documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/the-component-object-model)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The AgStkObjectRoot Object\n",
    "The `AgStkObjectRoot` object resides at the apex of the STK Object Model. The `AgStkObjectRoot` object and the associated `IAgSTKObjectRoot` interface provide the methods and properties to load scenarios, create new ones and access the Object Model Unit preferences. From the `AgStkObjectRoot` object, users can access all other objects and collections exposed by the STK Object Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of STK Object Model Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new Scenario\n",
    "# IAgStkObjectRoot root: STK Object Model Root\n",
    "root.NewScenario('Example_Scenario')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a facility (on the current scenario central body)\n",
    "# IAgStkObjectRoot root: STK Object Model Root\n",
    "facility = root.CurrentScenario.Children.New(8, 'MyFacility')  # 8 = eFacility\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a New Aircraft (on the current scenario central body)\n",
    "# IAgStkObjectRoot root: STK Object Model root\n",
    "aircraft = root.CurrentScenario.Children.New(1, 'MyAircraft')  # 1 = eAircraft\n",
    "```\n",
    "More [Python Code Snippets](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#stkObjects/ObjModPythonCodeSamples.htm) are available in the STK Programming Interface Help System.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the referenced enumeration values (`eFacility` and `eAircraft`) via the [AgESTKObjectType Enumeration](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#DocX/STKObjects~Enumerations~AgESTKObjectType_EN.html%3FTocPath%3DLibrary%2520Reference%7CSTK%2520Object%2520Model%7CSTK%2520Objects%7CEnumerations%7C_____233) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of the STK Object Model\n",
    "- The Object Model supports auto completion (i.e., IntelliSense, Javadoc) and compile-time debugging.\n",
    "- The Object Model is not dependent on report styles. Rather, data values are pulled directly from the [STK Data Providers](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#../Subsystems/dataProviders/Content/dpIntro.htm%3FTocPath%3DLibrary%2520Reference%7CData%2520Providers%2520Reference%7C_____0).\n",
    "- Data values returned from STK are returned as objects of an appropriate form, eliminating unnecessary string parsing. For instance, a series of data over time is returned as an array of values.\n",
    "- The Object Model generally offers parity between property setters and getters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STK Object Model Limitations\n",
    "- Becoming familiar with the Object Model involves a much steeper learning curve than Connect, particularly for non-programmers.\n",
    "- The Object Model, being COM technology, is limited to communication between applications on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of Connect or STK Object Model should be driven by the requirements of the application and the needs of the developer. It is important to note, however, that this need not be an exclusive choice. Connect commands can be used in a COM application, side-by-side with STK Object Model code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before attempting to code anything, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the **STK Programming Interface Help** system. Within the help system you will find a wealth of information including integration tutorials, code snippets, decision trees, and library references.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access this in several different ways including via AGI's website and the associated online [STK Programming Help](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm) page.  You can also use the menu bar in STK by selecting *Help &#8594; Programming Interface Help*, or launch the help via the windows Start Menu by selecting *Start &#8594; All Programs &#8594; STK 12 &#8594; STK 12 - Programming Interface Help*\n",
    "\n",
    "The help system tree looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/STKProgrammingHelp.png\" width=400></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the **Using Core Libraries** directory you will find additional information on using the STK Object Model and Connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/STKProgrammingHelpUsingCoreLibs.png\" width=400></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Connect** section listed under **Using Core Libraries** you will find useful **Getting Started** information outlining the basics of Connect command and response formats.  The section also contains useful code snippets that demonstrate the syntax for various Connect commands.  Here is an example of a code snippet showing how to create a new missile object:\n",
    "\n",

    ">This snippet utilizes STK Object Model to send the Connect command.  The raw Connect command is the string being passed to `root.ExecuteCommand()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **STK Object Model** section listed under **Using Core Libraries** contains useful code snippets in various programming languages.  It also contains information on the various COM libraries that make up the STK Object Model.  This information includes useful diagrams that help visualize how the STK Object Model is structured.  For example, this small excerpt from the STK Object diagrams which outlines a portion of the basic STK Object Model representation of a Place object:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/AgPlace.png\" width=600></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Library Reference** area lists extensive coding resources. In that section, you can find documentation on the STK Object Model, Connect Command Library, Data Providers, and more.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Connect Command Library**, listed under Library Reference houses the documentation for all of the Connect commands. Here, you can search for commands alphabetically, by object, and by module.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/STKProgrammingHelpLibRefConnect.png\" width=400></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The STK Object Model documentation is organized by the individual libraries. This means you can find a section for STK Objects, a section for STK Util, and so on. Within each section items are broken down further by their type.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Resources/STKProgrammingHelpLibRefOM.png\" width=400></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick way to find help on a given type is to use the Search tab of the Help system. For example, suppose you are interested in the `AgECoordinateSystem` enum. If you enter \"AgECoordinateSystem\" in the search field and click List Topics, a list of pages containing that term appears. The entry for the `AgECoordinateSystem` reference page will appear at the top. Select that entry to display a page defining the enum and listing its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Context Information\n",
    "In addition to help on programming issues, the help explains the real-world context where you might use these applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the STK Object Model help page for the [SpinAxisConeAngle](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#DocX/STKObjects~IAgSnPtSpinning~SpinAxisConeAngle.html?Highlight=SpinAxisConeAngle) property tells you basic information about SpinAxisConeAngle. The page explains `SpinAxisConeAngle`is writable, part of the Variant data type, and part of the `IAgSnPtSpinning` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the page tells you that the property represents \"the cone angle used in defining the spin axis; i.e., the angle between the spin axis and the sensor boresight.\" This additional information can explain whether to use the `SpinAxisConeAngle` property in your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information related to the real-world context, you can find the help page for [Spinning Sensor Pointing](https://help.agi.com/stk/index.htm#stk/referenceFramesSensorPointing.htm%3FTocPath%3DHow%2520to%2520Use%2520STK%7CTechnical%2520Notes%7C_____4) in the STK Help System. The STK Help system can give more detailed information on the real-world context than the STK Programming Help, which focuses on programming.\n",

Next, you will attach a Sensor to each of the Satellites and add each to an STK Constellation object.  Then, you will create another Constellation object for all the Facilities.  Finally, you will create a Chain object to compute access between the Facilities and the constellation of Sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Satellite Constellation Details\n",
    "The constellation of satellites you need to model is loosely based on the Iridium constellation.  The details of your constellation:\n",
    "- 4 orbital planes with RAANs of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees respectively.\n",
    "- 8 satellites per orbital plane, evenly spaced.  If the true anomaly of satellites is in an even-numbered orbital plane, then assume the anomaly starts at 0 degrees at the scenario's initial time. For odd-numbered orbital planes, the true anomaly starts at half the spacing between satellites (22.5 degrees) so that satellites in neighboring planes are staggered.\n",

    "Inserting the constellation of satellites begins with developing the code to insert a single satellite from the constellation.  In this section, you will use STK Object Model to insert a satellite into STK and to edit some of the satellite's properties.  Later, you will use this code to insert the entire constellation of satellites through a pair of nested loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the STK Object Model, new objects are inserted into STK through the `Children` property of the parent object.  The `Children` property provides a pointer to `IAgStkObjectCollection` which exposes the `New` method.  The `New` method expects to be passed a member of the `AgESTKObjectType` enumeration as the first argument, and a string representing the instance name of the object as the second argument.  `New` returns a pointer to `IAgStkObject` which you will need to \"cast\" to the object-specific interface to gain access to the object-specific properties.  Therefore, you will insert a satellite into the scenario by adding a new child to the scenario object.  Then, to access the satellite specific methods and properties you will need to \"cast\" the result to obtain access to the `IAgSatellite` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a quick look at the help page for the [AgESTKObjectType Enumeration](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#DocX/STKObjects~Enumerations~AgESTKObjectType_EN.html?Highlight=AgESTKObjectType).  Note, AgE indicates that this object is an enumeration, which is simply an object that provides a list of options.  Looking at this list, you can see that `eSatellite` is the member of the AgESTKObjectType enumeration that references the STK Satellite object and has a value of 18.  When providing the first argument to the `New` method, you can choose to either directly pass the value 18, or use the enumeration member which is accessible through the STKObjects library.\n",
